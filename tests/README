Collection of tests for beatadjoint
===================================

Running the tests:
------------------

We recommend running the tests from the test/unit/ directory. The complete
test suite can be run with:

  py.test

For quick testing, we recommend:

  py.test -m "not slow" -v

For parallel run install python-pytest-xdist.
Disable the xdist plugin by:

  py.test -p no:xdist

To see the standard output of the tests, as well as for dropping into an 
debugger or embedded IPython shell you want to use:

  py.test -p no:xdist -s

----------------------------------------

  @fast   : (complete) test < ~1 s
  @medium : (complete) test < ~10 s
  @slow   : (complete) test > ~10 s
