Collection of tests for beatadjoint
===================================

Running the tests:
------------------

We recommend running the tests from the test/unit/ directory. The complete
test suite can be run with:

  py.test

For quick testing, we recommend:

  py.test -m "not slow" -v

For parallel run install python-pytest-xdist.
Enable the xdist plugin by:

  py.test -n N

where N is the number of cores to be used.

To see the standard output of the tests, as well as for dropping into an
debugger or embedded IPython shell you want to use:

  py.test -s

Guidelines for organizing the tests:
----------------------------------------

  @fast   : (complete) test < ~1 s
  @medium : (complete) test < ~10 s
  @slow   : (complete) test > ~10 s
